(WORK IN PROGRESS).

This repisotory contains the data and code for the analysis in the draft paper "The emergence of the etiological standpoint. Changes of moral classification in the history of poor relief"

## Code

This folder contains notebooks that provide the code for creating text corpora, preprocessing, training word embeddings, and generating results.

## Data

This folder contains the dataset used in the word embeddings. I will make it available here as soon as I have checked possible copyright restrictions. 

## Tables

Once the analyis is reproduced, this folder will contain the results used in the draft (table 1 and table 2).
