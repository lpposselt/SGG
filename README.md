Word embeddings for poverty discourse in the Swiss Charitable Society (1811-1922)
(WORK IN PROGRESS).

This repisotory contains the data and code for the analysis in the draft paper "The emergence of the etiological standpoint. Changes of moral classification in the history of poor relief"

## Code

This folder contains notebooks that provide the code for creating text corpora, preprocessing, training word embeddings, and generating results.

## Data

This folder will contain the dataset used for the word embeddings. I'll make it available as soon as I verify any copyright restrictions.

## Tables

Once the analyis is reproduced, this folder will contain the results used in the draft (table 1 and table 2).
